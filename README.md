# My Job Application Tracker

Just for funsies, because keeping track of all this stuff in a todo list is getting a little unwieldy and this will let me share this stuff a little more readily.

## TODO

- [x] Initial setup
- [x] Scaffold UI
- [x] Set up database
- [x] Create DB schema for "job application" (status, title, company, workday link)
- [x] Add Auth (auth.js)
- [x] Add dashboard/application management page for signed in user
- [x] Add new job applications
- [x] Edit job application status
- [x] Update applications to be linked to the user
- [ ] Delete job applications?
