# My Job Application Tracker

Just for funsies, because keeping track of all this stuff in a todo list is getting a little unwieldy.

## TODO

[ ] Create DB schema for "job application" (status, title, company, workday link, notes)
[ ] Scaffold UI
[ ] Add Auth
[ ] Add new job applications
[ ] Edit job application status
[ ] Delete job applications
